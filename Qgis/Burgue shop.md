# Where should I open a new frachise?


## 1. The Problem
Tomas has a samll Burguer shop and he wants to open and franchise, because your business is doing well, so he hired me to help him to choose the best place to open your nhew Burguer Shop. In our first meet I tell you that we need mapping the 
concorrece, and it's easy in a samll city or in a small neighborhood, but he wants to search a place in Orlando indepent of a neighborhood, and he wants the raiting of each Burguer shop in rating site beacause it's will be important to select the best place. 
I agreed with him and I said that was been important known about the size and the purchasing power of population in each neighborhood. 

## 2. How can I get the localization of each burger Sho in Orlando?
To this problem I gonna use scrap techinics of web maps site, like bing, google maps.
